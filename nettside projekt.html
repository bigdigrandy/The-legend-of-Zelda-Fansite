<h1> Creators </hi>

<h2> The legend of Zelda was developed/created by Nintendo. The founder of Nintendo was Shigeru Miyamoto from Japan, made the legend of Zelda as a action based adveture game and was inspired from his childhood experiences, where he explored the forests, caves and lakes near his home in Japan. He wanted to create a game that captured the sense of adventure and exploration he felt as a child, and The Legend of Zelda was the result! Another importiant person when it comes to the legend of Zelda's team is Eiji Aonuma, who joined the team when they where working on the first 3D Zelda game: The legend of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time. Eiji was the lead disigner to Ocarina of time and its sequel majoras mask. And he has worked on the team since. <h2>
